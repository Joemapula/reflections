When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You'd wnat to use a remote repository rather than a local one when 
    you want to share work with others or collaborate simultaneously 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes from GitHub manually allows you to have a choice. 
    If GitHub's repository has changes you don't want or need, then 
    automatic pushes may overwrite your own before you can finish them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A Fork is a clone on GitHub rather than a local computer
    A clone is a copy on a local computer 
    A branch is a segment of a commit tree that copies it's parent 
    but who's future commit history is separate from other branches 
    A Fork and a branch help keep track of different versions 
    A branch is a more zoomed in version of a Fork
    A branch happens on a single repository 
    A Fork is a clone GitHub makes for you on their own machines
